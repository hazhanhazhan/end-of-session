                Hello, I am Hazal Hangul, I live in Ankara. 
                I love watching TV shows and movies, reading books and developing web pages with React. 
                I am constantly trying to learn in order to specialize and advance in these areas. 
                I also practice on coding languages and new technologies.

            <h2>My Favorite TV Show</h2>

            <h3>Sherlock</h3>
        
            <p>
                Sherlock is a British mystery crime drama television series based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes detective stories. 
                Created by Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, it stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman as Doctor John Watson. 
                Thirteen episodes have been produced, with four three-part series airing from 2010 to 2017 and a special episode that aired on 1 January 2016. 
                The series is set in the present day, while the one-off special features a Victorian period fantasy resembling the original Holmes stories.
